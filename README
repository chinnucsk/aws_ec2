Another erlang EC2 client. My first OTP app so may be incorrect. Uses the Version 2 signature for AWS.

Requires both erlang-format (find it on git hub) and erlsom.

This is the first push. Only working API calls are run_instance[s], describe_instance[s] and terminate_instance[s]. 

I'm going to generate the rest later and add them.
